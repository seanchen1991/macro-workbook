# Introduction

## Motivation

Macros are a bit of an advanced concept in the Rust programming language. At their most fundamental level, macros are all about taking some Rust code as input and spitting out Rust code as output. As a result, if you wish to write a macro of your own, a certain base level of knowledge and familiarity with Rust's syntax is necessary. 

In between the input and output steps, there exists a wide range of possible things that can be done; a lot of these things are quite powerful, and add a lot of flexbility and extensibility to the Rust language. 

This makes things a bit tricky for newer Rust programmers who are trying to level up their proficiency in the language by perusing the codebases of popular Rust crates: macros are generally pretty prevalent in these crates! 

The main goal of this book is informed by this tension. It seeks to make the ramp-up for learning macros in Rust as smooth as possible.
