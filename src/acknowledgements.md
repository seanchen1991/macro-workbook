# Acknowledgements

This book was made possible by many others' work, either in te form of inspiration, or more concrete ideas that I repurposed into exercises. I try to keep this list as exhaustive as I can, but please forgive me for any gaps.

 - Exercism's Rust [track](exercism-rust), where the idea for the `hashmap` exercise came from.
 - David Tolnay's [proc-macro-workshop](proc-macro-workshop) for providing the initial impetus for creating a resource on Rust macros with smoother edges.
 - Daniel Keep's [_The Little Book of Rust Macros_](daniel-keep-tlborm) for being a great resource that thoroughly breaks down how `macro_rules` works, as well as providing the idea for the [Ook!](ook) exercise; shoutout as well to Veykril's actively-maintained [fork]() of Daniel's book.
 - Mara Bos's blog [series](mara-blog) on writing inline Python in Rust.
 - The Macros [chapter](trpl-macros) in _The Rust Programming Language_ for providing a clear introduction on the subject of macros in Rust.
